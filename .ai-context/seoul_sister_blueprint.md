## üñ§ BLACK & GOLD LUXURY DESIGN SYSTEM
*Rolex-Inspired Sophistication with K-Beauty Elegance*

### **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**
Seoul Sister achieves **Rolex-level sophistication** - a confident, minimal, purposeful design that whispers luxury rather than shouting it. This is the premium standard that must be maintained across all future development.

### **COLOR PALETTE**
```css
:root {
  /* Core Luxury Palette - DO NOT CHANGE */
  --luxury-black: #000000;
  --luxury-black-soft: #0A0A0A;
  --luxury-charcoal: #1A1A1A;
  --luxury-gold: #D4A574;        /* Muted sophisticated gold */
  --luxury-gold-bright: #FFD700;
  --luxury-gold-muted: #B8956A;
  --luxury-white: #FFFFFF;
  --luxury-pearl: #FAFAFA;
  --luxury-gray: #888888;
  --luxury-gray-light: #CCCCCC;

  /* Subtle Accents */
  --luxury-rose-gold: #E8D5C4;
  --luxury-blush: #FFF5F0;

  /* Refined Gradients */
  --luxury-gradient: linear-gradient(180deg, #D4A574 0%, #B8956A 100%);
  --black-gradient: linear-gradient(180deg, #0A0A0A 0%, #000000 100%);
  --subtle-gold: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 0%, rgba(212, 165, 116, 0.05) 50%, transparent 100%);
}
```

### **TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM**
```css
/* Typography Standards - REQUIRED */
.heading-hero {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
  font-weight: 300;  /* Ultra-light for sophistication */
  letter-spacing: 0.08em;
  line-height: 1.1;
}

.heading-section {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', Georgia, serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 0.04em;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

.text-caption {
  font-size: 12px;
  letter-spacing: 0.15em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: var(--luxury-gold);
  font-weight: 400;
  opacity: 0.8;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
  font-weight: 300;
  letter-spacing: 0.02em;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
```

### **LAYOUT PRINCIPLES**
1. **Massive Breathing Room**: Every section has generous padding (py-32 minimum)
2. **Clean Grid Layouts**: Product grids with thin gold borders (2px gap)
3. **Minimalist Cards**: Black backgrounds with subtle gold border on hover
4. **No Bouncing/Floating**: Only subtle 1-2px translateY on hover
5. **Fixed Navigation**: Backdrop blur effect, shrinks on scroll

### **COMPONENT STANDARDS**

#### Buttons
```css
.btn-luxury {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--luxury-gold);
  border: 1px solid var(--luxury-gold);
  padding: 16px 48px;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 0.15em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
}

.btn-luxury:hover {
  background: var(--luxury-gold);
  color: var(--luxury-black);
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

#### Product Cards
```css
.product-card {
  background: var(--luxury-black);
  padding: 40px;
  transition: all 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1);
}

.product-card:hover {
  background: var(--luxury-black-soft);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
```

#### Badges
```css
.badge-insider {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 6px 16px;
  background: transparent;
  border: 1px solid var(--luxury-gold);
  color: var(--luxury-gold);
  font-size: 11px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 0.2em;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

### **ANIMATION GUIDELINES**
1. **Subtle Transitions**: 0.4s cubic-bezier(0.165, 0.84, 0.44, 1)
2. **Hover Effects**: Maximum 2px movement
3. **No Pulsing/Bouncing**: Only fade and slight transforms
4. **Reveal Animation**: Simple opacity and 20px translateY
5. **No Shimmer/Glitter**: Keep it sophisticated

### **SECTION STRUCTURE**
```html
<!-- Standard Section Template -->
<section class="section-dark py-32">
  <div class="luxury-container">
    <div class="text-center mb-20">
      <p class="text-caption mb-4">SECTION LABEL</p>
      <h2 class="heading-section text-5xl md:text-6xl mb-8">
        Section Headline
      </h2>
      <div class="gold-line mx-auto"></div>
    </div>
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</section>
```

### **MESSAGING GUIDELINES**
- **Language**: "INSIDER ACCESS" not "EXPOSED"
- **Tone**: Exclusive, sophisticated, invitation-only
- **CTAs**: "REQUEST INSIDER ACCESS" not "Get Deal Now"
- **Pricing**: Show savings elegantly, not aggressively
- **Community**: "Seoul Sisters" as exclusive club members

### **FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS**
‚ùå Bright red "EXPOSED" badges
‚ùå Floating/bouncing animations
‚ùå Multiple competing gradients
‚ùå Excessive emojis
‚ùå Crowded layouts
‚ùå Discount language ("cheap", "deal", "bargain")
‚ùå Aggressive urgency tactics

### **REQUIRED ELEMENTS**
‚úÖ Deep black backgrounds
‚úÖ Strategic gold accents (#D4A574)
‚úÖ Generous white space
‚úÖ Ultra-light font weights
‚úÖ All-caps labels with wide letter-spacing
‚úÖ Subtle 1-2px hover effects
‚úÖ Clean grid layouts
‚úÖ Sophisticated language

### **RESPONSIVE DESIGN**
```css
.luxury-container {
  max-width: 1400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 40px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .luxury-container {
    padding: 0 20px;
  }
}
```

### **QUALITY CHECKLIST**
Before any design implementation:
- [ ] Does it feel like Rolex-level luxury?
- [ ] Is gold used sparingly as accent only?
- [ ] Is there generous breathing room?
- [ ] Are animations subtle (1-2px max)?
- [ ] Is typography ultra-light and spacious?
- [ ] Does it maintain black & gold consistency?
- [ ] Is the language sophisticated?
- [ ] Would this fit in a luxury mall?

### **DESIGN INSPIRATION REFERENCES**
- **Primary**: Rolex.com (navigation, spacing, restraint)
- **Secondary**: Chanel.com (typography, minimalism)
- **Tertiary**: Apple.com (clean layouts, product presentation)

### **FUTURE-PROOFING**
This design system is **LOCKED** and should not be deviated from. Any new features must:
1. Use the existing color palette
2. Follow the typography standards
3. Maintain generous spacing
4. Keep animations subtle
5. Use sophisticated language
6. Preserve the luxury aesthetic
