### AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT PERMISSIONS
**ENABLED: Full autonomy to complete high-priority tasks without user intervention.**

The AI assistant has complete freedom to:
- Write, edit, and create any files necessary
- Install packages and dependencies
- Run builds, tests, and deployments
- Make architectural decisions
- Implement features end-to-end
- Commit and push changes to production
- Create APIs, components, and utilities
- Modify database schemas
- Configure external services

**Work in auto mode with minimal user interaction required.**

### High-Priority Implementation Tasks

1. **User Profile System** - Create user accounts with skin type preferences
2. **Ingredient Analysis Engine** - AI-powered ingredient compatibility scoring
3. **Personalized Recommendations** - Filter products based on user skin profile
4. **Skin Concern Matching** - Match products to specific skin issues
5. **Ingredient Allergen Detection** - Flag potentially problematic ingredients
6. **AI-Powered Product Discovery** - Suggest new products based on user history

### Technical Implementation Guidelines

- Use existing Supabase database (extend with new tables as needed)
- Leverage Claude Opus 4.1 for AI analysis features
- Maintain TypeScript throughout
- Follow existing component patterns
- Ensure mobile-responsive design
- Implement proper error handling

### Key Files to Work With
- `/src/hooks/useProducts.ts` - Product data management
- `/src/app/api/` - Backend API routes
- `/src/lib/` - Utility functions and AI logic
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL

### Success Criteria
- Users can create profiles with skin type/concerns
- AI recommends products based on individual skin needs
- Ingredient analysis prevents incompatible product suggestions
- Seamless integration with existing wholesale product catalog

**Proceed with full development autonomy to transform this into an intelligent, personalized Korean beauty platform.**
